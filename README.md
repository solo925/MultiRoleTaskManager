# TEACH2GIVE Group 7 Project

## About the Project

This repository contains the source code for **TEACH2GIVE Group 7**, a collaborative project that implements CRUD operations within a web-based application. The project is designed to help users create, view, and delete posts, with different permission levels for users and administrators. The goal is to allow users to contribute and interact with posts while ensuring proper access control through role-based permissions.

## Project Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - **Admin**: Full access to create, view, update, and delete posts.
  - **User**: Can create and view posts but cannot delete posts created by others.
- **Post Management**
  - Users can create and view posts.
  - Admins can manage (create, update, delete) any posts.
- **Responsive UI**: A mobile-friendly interface designed for a seamless experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript** for the structure and styling of the web pages.
- **React.js** (or another framework you may have used) to build the user interface.

### Backend

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for creating server-side logic.
- **Postgressql** for storing data in a database.
<!-- - **Mongoose** for managing database operations. -->
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and session management.
